Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I was wondering - does Intra platform have an option to switch to a light theme instead of dark mode? After a while, all I see is white text everywhere in my room! ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜† Would love to know if there's a way to change it! 

When I set my availability, does the end time mean when is the last slot available to book or by when latest the review must finish? For example if I set my availability till 14:00 is there a chance to get a review booked that starts at 14:00 or latest review would be 13:15?

Hi, maybe someone can explain. According to UZT rules, I have to study Schedule needs to contain exactly 30 hours. Let's say I see that I see on the calendar that there are 5 hours of activities scheduled for a particular day. This means that I must participate in all these activities at the specified time and I cannot change the time of the scheduled activities in any way?
